## Introduction

**16 Basic OpenCV**
  - OpenCV or the Open spurve Computer Vision Library is one of the most widely used libraries for computer vision tasks. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for performing operations such as image processing, object detection, and video analysis. With its wide range of functionalities, OpenCV has become an essential resource for researchers, engineers, and developers working in fields that require visual data analysis.

**Demonstrating Morphological Dilation**
  - Morphological dilation is a fundamental operation in image processing, particularly in the field of computer vision. It is part of a group of techniques known as morphological operations, which manipulate the structure or shape of objects within an image based on their spatial relationships. These operations are particularly useful for analyzing and processing images in binary or grayscale formats.
